    <p>I sit in traffic a lot... and I hate it.  I wanted to very quickly get a real-time view of the cameras provided by <a href="http://www.511sc.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">511sc.org</a>.  Their website is also very useful, but requires clicking on individual cameras to load, similar to the map view on my sight. I wanted to see more than camera at once, which is why this site was born.</p>
    <p>The current version of this site is built using many of the Open Source tools provided by my current team and others at <a href="https://www.blackbaud.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Blackbaud</a>.  Specifically, <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SKY UX Components</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SKY UX Builder</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/stache2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stache</a>.</p>

  <sky-alert alertType="info">
    <strong>Heads up!</strong> The camera feeds are currently available via RTMP and HLS, both of which require Adobe Flash Player in most desktop browsers. For the best user experience, I suggest enabling Flash for this site.
