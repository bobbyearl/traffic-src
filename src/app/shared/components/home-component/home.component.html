    <p>I sit in traffic a lot... and I hate it.  I wanted to very quickly get a real-time view of the cameras provided by <a href="http://www.511sc.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">511sc.org</a>.  Their website is also very useful, but requires clicking on individual cameras to load, similar to the map view on this sight. I wanted to see more than one camera at once, which is why this site was born.</p>
